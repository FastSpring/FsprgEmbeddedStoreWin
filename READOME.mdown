# About FsprgEmbeddedStore SDK #

FastSpring's embedded store consists of a controller with some integration points and WPF's WebBrowser control. It's thin and very flexible and lets you integrate FastSpring the way that fits best for your application.

FastSpring provides FsprgEmbeddedStore class library's source code as VisualStudio project. It's straight forward to integrate, eases debugging and gives you a better understanding of what happens behind the scenes. The test application requires Windows XP or higher. All source code is released under the [MIT license](FsprgEmbeddedStoreWin/raw/master/License.txt). It is open to contributions and its use is unrestricted.

# How-to build #

You can download the repository and use VisualStudio to build it. [build.sh](FsprgEmbeddedStoreWin/raw/master/build.sh) packs the source code and adds a nicely formatted documentation (HOW_TO.html).

Or you can download the packed SDK [here](FsprgEmbeddedStoreWin/downloads) (section Download Packages) if you don't want to pack it by yourself.

# How-to integrate
